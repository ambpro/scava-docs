# Welcome to the Scava documentation

This repository contains all the documentation pertaining to the Eclipse Scava project.

The documentation system used for Scava relies on Markdown files, stored in the `docs/` directory.
These can be converted to a full static web site using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). The configured output directory for html files is `site/`, which can then be served directly by any web server.

There are two intended deployment sites:

* GitHub project pages: [https://crossminer.github.io/scava-docs](https://crossminer.github.io/scava-docs)
* ReadTheDocs: [https://scava-docs.readthedocs.io](https://scava-docs.readthedocs.io)
