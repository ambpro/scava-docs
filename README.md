# Welcome to the Scava documentation

This repository contains all the documentation pertaining to the [Eclipse Scava project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.scava).

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/scava-docs/badge/?version=master)](https://scava-docs.readthedocs.io/en/master/?badge=master)

The documentation system used for Scava relies on Markdown files, stored in the `docs/` directory.
These can be converted to a full static web site using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). The configured output directory for html files is `site/`, which can then be served directly by any web server.

There are two intended deployment sites:

* GitHub project pages: [https://crossminer.github.io/scava-docs](https://crossminer.github.io/scava-docs)
* ReadTheDocs: [https://scava-docs.readthedocs.io](https://scava-docs.readthedocs.io)
