                <h1 id="development-guidelines">Development Guidelines</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document presents the guidelines about the processes and tools supporting the development of the Scava platform. In particular, Sec 2 presents an overview of the main development workflow by highlighting the main tools of the supporting development infrastructure. Section 3 mentions peculiar conventions that have to be adopted to write source code and to perform changes. Section 4 makes a list of tools supporting communication and collaboration among the different partners. Section 5 gives some important remarks related to the Scava project and its development.</p>
<h2 id="process-overview">Process overview</h2>
<p>The development of the Scava components and of the integrated platform should follow the process shown in the following figure. Essentially, the development relies on the availability of a source code repository (to enable collaborative development) and of a Continuous Integration Server (to do the building and integration on behalf of the developers). Different deployment environments can be considered for deploying the built system.</p>
<p>It is important to remark that Continuous Integration (CI) requires that the different developers have self-testing code. This is code that tests itself to ensure that it is working as expected, and these tests are often called unit tests. When all the unit tests pass after the code is integrated, developers will get a green build. This indicates that they have verified that their changes are successfully integrated together, and the code is working as expected by the tests.</p>
<p>The different elements shown below are individually described in the remaining of the section.</p>
<p><img alt="Dev Process for Scava" src="../images/scava_dev_process_1.png" />
Figure 1. Overview of the CROSSMINER development process and tools</p>
<h3 id="source-code-repository">Source Code Repository</h3>
<p>Different branches will be created in the repository. In particular, the <code>master</code> branch is the main branch and represents the released state of the product. The <code>dev</code> branch contains the most recent code integrated by partners before release. These two branches are always clean, build and run all the tests successfully.</p>
<p>Other branches will be created for the different features/components, which will be eventually merged in the <code>dev</code> branch. The name of each branch contains the id of the issue it is supposed to implement.</p>
<p>All source code, binary code and conﬁguration needed to build a working implementation of the system will reside in a GitHub repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>Code: https://github.com/crossminer/scava</li>
<li>Product documentation: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-docs</li>
<li>Product deployment: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all source code will be stored in a single GitHub repository, each developer will have a working copy of the entire project. To simplify collaboration, each component will be contained in one subdirectory within the source structure (see Sec. 3 for details).</p>
<p>By taking inspiration from https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html the branching model that will be followed will resemble that shown in Fig. 2 without making use of the release and hotfixes branches. Details about the change conventions, pull requests, etc. are given in Sec. 3.</p>
<p><img alt="Git development workflow" src="../images/scava_dev_process_2.png" />
Figure 2: Branching model</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>
<p>Each branch must have the corresponding unit tests. The dev branch must have integration tests and the unit tests of all the features that have been already merged as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="Master and branches" src="../images/scava_dev_process_3.png" />

<h3 id="continuous-integration-server">Continuous Integration Server</h3>
<p>Continuous integration (CI) involves integrating early and often, so as to avoid the pitfalls of "integration hell". The practice aims to reduce rework and thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">reduce cost and time</a>.</p>
<p>A complementary practice to CI is that before submitting work, each programmer must do a complete build and run (and pass) all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_tests">unit tests</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">Integration tests</a> are usually run automatically on a CI server when it detects a new commit. In particular, a CI server provides developers with at least the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow developers to write unit tests that can be executed automatically</li>
<li>Perform automated tests against newly written code</li>
<li>Show a list of tests that have passed and failed</li>
<li>Quality analysis on source code</li>
<li>Perform all the necessary actions to create a fully functioning build of the software when all tests have passed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development-and-production-environments">Development and Production environments</h3>
<p>According to the DoW we have not promised the availability of a public installation of the Scava platform (i.e., a production environment). However, in order to implement the different use cases it might be the case of providing use case partners with at least a development environment, which will be used by all the members of the consortium. The effectiveness, precision, etc. of the Scava recommendations will very much depend on the available and analyzed data. Having different installations of the system might not be an efficient way to collect data and produce a big enough knowledge base, which is required to support the use case implementations.</p>
<h2 id="naming-and-change-conventions">Naming and change conventions</h2>
<p>The repository will contain the code of the high-level components shown in Table 1</p>

<p>For each component a corresponding folder is available in the repository. Changes must have a CR (i.e. issue) entry for traceability. In particular, the requirements and objectives of each Scava components will be detailed in the relevant deliverables and they will be added in the form of items in the provided Bug Tracking infrastructure. In this way progress on the implementation of each requirement can be tracked. Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>when developers want to operate changes they have to create corresponding issues in the bug tracking system for traceability reasons;</li>
<li>when a developer wants to perform changes on a component led by an organization, which is different than that the developer belongs to, a pull request (PR) has to be done. Such a PR will be managed by one of the members of the organization leading the component affected by the changes in the PR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The partner in charge of managing the development of a component will be free to organize the content of the corresponding subdirectory in any way as long as the following standard ﬁles/directories are contained in the component folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>readme.md. This ﬁle will contain the entry-point to all documentation for the component.</li>
<li>Other legal documentation as described in the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc">Eclipse process handbook</a>.</li>
<li>build: This will be a ﬁle containing executable script code which can automatically run on the target environment. The objective of this build script is to do whatever automated operations are necessary (such as compiling and packaging) to produce a working component.</li>
<li>tests: this is a folder containing the unit and/or integration tests</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="communication-and-collaboration-means">Communication and collaboration means</h2>
<p>The development activities can be done by exploiting different communication and collaboration means. In particular, currently the consortium members have the availability of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack channel: http://crossminer.slack.com</li>
<li>Eclipse Mailing lists: https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/scava-dev</li>
<li>GitHub repository for documentation: https://github.com/crossminer/scava-docs/</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remark">Remark</h2>
<p>I recall that we are running a research and innovative project. Reviewers that will evaluate our work will not be impressed by the fact that 100% of our tests succeed, that we perfectly adhere to a detailed code convention, etc. Of course, the community will do!!! Thus, we have to find a reasonably compromise:</p>
<ul>
<li>to have all the deliverables accepted !!!</li>
<li>to develop in a way, which is preparatory to achieve our “dreams”</li>
</ul>
<p>“Better have a low test coverage than a part of our tests fail” [cit. Boris] :-)</p>
