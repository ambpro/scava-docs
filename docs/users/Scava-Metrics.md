## Metric-platform

**OSGi metrics** are defined in:

* https://github.com/crossminer/scava/blob/master/metric-platform/metric-providers/org.eclipse.scava.metricprovider.trans.rascal.dependency.osgi/src/OSGi.rsc

List of metrics:

* allOSGiBundleDependencies -- Retrieves all the OSGi bunlde dependencies (i.e. Require-Bundle dependencies).
* allOSGiPackageDependencies -- Retrieves all the OSGi package dependencies (i.e. Import-Package and DynamicImport-Package dependencies).
* allOSGiDynamicImportedPackages -- Retrieves all the OSGi dynamically imported packages. If returned value != {} a smell exists in the Manifest file.
* numberOSGiPackageDependencies -- Retrieves the number of OSGi package dependencies (i.e. Import-Package and DynamicImport-Package dependencies).
* numberOSGiBundleDependencies -- Retrieves the number of OSGi bunlde dependencies (i.e. Require-Bundle dependencies).
* unusedOSGiImportedPackages -- Retrieves the set of unused OSGi imported packages. If set != {} then developers are importing more packages than needed (smell).
* ratioUnusedOSGiImportedPackages -- Retrieves the ratio of unused OSGi imported packages with regards to the whole set of imported and dynamically imported OSGi packages.
* ratioUsedOSGiImportedPackages -- Retrieves the ratio of used imported packages. If ratio == 0.0 all imported packages have been used in the project code.
* numberOSGiSplitImportedPackages -- Retrieves the number of split imported packages. If returned value > 0 there is a smell in the Manifest.
* numberOSGiSplitExportedPackages -- Retrieves the number of split exported packages. If returned value > 0 there is a smell in the Manifest..
* unversionedOSGiRequiredBundles -- Retrieves the set of unversioned OSGi required bundles (declared in the Require-Bundle header.
* ratioUnversionedOSGiRequiredBundles -- Retrieves the ratio of unversioned OSGi required bundles.
* unversionedOSGiImportedPackages -- Retrieves the set of unversioned OSGi imported packages (declared in the Import-Package header). If returned value != {} there is a smell in the Manifest.
* ratioUnversionedOSGiImportedPackages -- Retrieves the ratio of unversioned OSGi imported packages.
* unversionedOSGiExportedPackages -- Retrieves the set of unversioned OSGi exported packages (declared in the Export-Package header). If returned value != {} there is a smell in the Manifest.
* ratioUnversionedOSGiExportedPackages -- Retrieves the ratio of unversioned OSGi exported packages.

**Maven metrics** are defined in 

* https://github.com/crossminer/scava/blob/master/metric-platform/metric-providers/org.eclipse.scava.metricprovider.trans.rascal.dependency.maven/src/Maven.rsc

List of metrics:

## Natural Language Processing

All metrics are defined in [metrics_definition_nlp.docx](/resources/metrics_definition_nlp.docx).

**Issue tracking** metrics:

* Number of bugs: It indicates how many bugs, through the time, are in total all the issue tracking systems related to a project.
* Number of comments: This metric indicates, through the time, the evolution in the quantity of comments for all the bugs related to a project.
* Emotions: This metric expresses, grosso modo, the emotions found in the issue tracker for a given project.
* Number new bugs: It indicates how many bugs are created every delta through a lapse of time.
* Number of new users: How many users are new in the bug tracking system.
* Open time: This metric shows the average open time of an issue.
* Number of patches: It indicates the number of patches located in the issue tracking system.
* Number of request and replies: From all the comments in the issue tracking system, how many of them are replies and how many are requests.
* Response time: It presents the average time to reply a comment in an issue tracker.
* Sentiments: Which sentiments are found in a issue tracking system for a project.
* Severity: The severity level of the bugs found in the issue tracker. This metric classifies a bug report into 1 of 7 severity levels such as Blocker, Critical, Major, Normal, Minor, Trivial or Enhancement.
* Status: It indicates the issues status, like open or closed.
* Topics: Using clustering methods, this metric indicates the topics that are discussed through the time.
* Unasnwered bugs: It indicates how many issues do not have any reply.
* Users: How many users are found in a issue tracker system.

**Newsgroup** metrics

* Number of articles; It determines the number of articles found in a newsgroup.
* Emotions: Which emotions are found in the newgroup.
* Number of threads: How many threads a newsgroup contains. In other words, how many different branches have been created since the first email was sent to the newsgroup.
* Number of new users: How many users make use of the newsgroup.
* Number of request and replies: From the total number of emails belonging to the newsgroup, how many of them are request and how many are replies.
* Response time: The average time to reply a message.
* Sentiments: The sentiments found in the newsgroup.
* Severity: The severity level of the messages exchanges in the newsgroup. The severity is measured in terms of how severe an issue is.
* Number of new threads: How many threads are created per delta.
* Topics: Using the clustering algorithm, we determine which are the most frequent topics discussed in the newsgroup.
* Number of unanswered topics: How many messages havenâ€™t been answered.
* Number of users: Number of users that make use of the newsgroup.

**Forums** metrics

* Number of posts: For every topic (i.e. forum thread), how many posts in total exist.
* Emotions: Which are the emotions located in the forum.
* Number of topics: How many forum threads contain the forum.
* Number of request and replies: From all the posts in the forum, how many are request and how many are reply.
* Sentiments: Which are the sentiments that can be found in a forum.
* Severity: In the case the forums are used to express issues, we can determine their severity.
* Number of new topics: Number of new forum threads created.
* Topics: Number of content topics, i.e. subjects, are discussed in the forum. 
* Number of unanswered topics: Number of forums threads which do not have a reply.
